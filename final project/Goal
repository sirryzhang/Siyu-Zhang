Project name: 
Major Light Pad


Goal: 
I want to use this project to make the hand's motion visible and audible.  
Behavior is an interesting topic that we talked again and again. 
But normally, the movement we know is just an intensive behavior of people, 
the motion is a very short-term memory, which can be forgotten in a very short period. 
But if the motion can be visualized, amazed people in some way, it can be unforgettable. 
This is the reason why I want to do this project.
The most attractive feature of Arduino is that it can transfer multi-sense of human behavior. 
We can use hundreds of sensors to detect the change of world and people, include distance, sounds, color, light, distance, etc. 
And change them into another entirely different sense. This is how I achieve my goal of transfer motion into visual light and sound.
In my project, I use inferred and ultrasound distant sensors to detect and analyses the motion data, is the hand nearby? 
And how far it has from the hand to the pad. 
And then With the distance get closer and closer, the 16 lights on the pad will turn on. And also with the different position on the pad, 
It can produce the notes Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, and Si. Users can use this pad to make random songs by hand motion. 
Also, they can play it as an instrument.
