I have 2 ideas on my final project,
First one is making a small robot.It will move randomly.Also it can attack the walls around it, 
  walls have different colors.The robot can produce different sounds according to the different color.
The second one is to make a structure like a flower, when there are a lot of light, it will open. 
when there is no light it will close.
