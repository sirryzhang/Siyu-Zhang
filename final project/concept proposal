I have 2 ideas on my final project,
First one is making a small robot.It will move randomly.Also it can attack the walls around them, 
  walls have different colors.The robot can produce different sounds according to the different color.
The second one is to make a combination between arduino and processing. 
  Such like to make a pressure sensor input and then when you press the physical surface,the screen will show a circle.
